# Packages and versions
The R and RStudio installations used (on 2025 M4 Macbook Air running Sequoia v15.5)
A number of packages are required and were preinstalled in RStudio:
Base packages:
- tidyverse
- knitr
- ggplot2
- remotes
- BiocManager
- devtools
- kableExtra

Specific packages from bioconductor:
- flowCore
- flowWorkspace
- openCyto
- flowAI
- ggcyto
- CytoML

```{r message = FALSE}
#Load required packages
library(flowCore)
library(CytoML)
library(flowAI)
library(flowWorkspace)
library(ggcyto)
library(tidyverse)
library(openCyto)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
```

Document the versions:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

This setting causes R to reach large files in chunks.
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache.lazy = FALSE)
```

# Reading in the data
The `read.flowSet` command from `flowCore` is used to read one or several FCS files.
```{r}
read.flowSet()
```





## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
